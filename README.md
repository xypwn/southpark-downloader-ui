# southpark-downloader-ui
[EARLY RELEASE] Fully self-contained South Park downloader GUI, written in Go for Linux, Windows, MacOS &amp; Android.

The code is currently still quite messy, and will definitely need some more work. If you have any request or criticism in particular, feel free to open an issue.

## Running the binary
### Download
[From GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xypwn/southpark-downloader-ui/releases/latest)

### MacOS
Thanks to @KatzeMau for testing

Open a terminal and run `chmod +x <binary file name>`. This makes it so you can run the file.

Apple doesn't like it if you run programs that aren't certified by Apple.

To run the program, you have to right-click it, then press open (NOT double-click!). It will show a warning and ask you if you really want to run the program. Press confirm.
