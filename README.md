## Running the app
### Download
- [Windows (64-bit)](https://github.com/xypwn/southpark-downloader-ui/releases/latest/download/southpark-downloader-ui-windows-amd64.exe)
- [Linux (64-bit)](https://github.com/xypwn/southpark-downloader-ui/releases/latest/download/southpark-downloader-ui-linux-amd64.tar.xz)
- [MacOS (Intel)](https://github.com/xypwn/southpark-downloader-ui/releases/latest/download/southpark-downloader-ui-macos-amd64.tar.gz)
- [MacOS (Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/xypwn/southpark-downloader-ui/releases/latest/download/southpark-downloader-ui-macos-arm64.tar.gz)

### Windows
Open the .exe file.

If it complains about the app being unknown to Microsoft, you can click "More info" -> "Run anyway". The warning should no longer appear after that.

### Linux
Extract the archive.

Open a terminal in the extracted directory that contains the `Makefile`.

Run `sudo make install` (system-wide) or `make user-install` (local).

### MacOS
Extract the archive.

Run the .app using **right click** (two fingers), or it will NOT open.

### From source (advanced users)
You need to install [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/) first

`git clone https://github.com/xypwn/southpark-downloader-ui && cd southpark-downloader-ui`

`go build ./cmd/southpark-downloader-ui`

If there's no error message, you should now have an executable binary called `southpark-downloader-ui` (with a `.exe` at the end for Windows)
